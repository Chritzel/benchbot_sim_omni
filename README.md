## Using this simulator with the BenchBot Robot Controller

The [BenchBot Robot Controller](https://github.com/qcr/benchbot_robot_controller) is a wrapping ROS / HTTP hybrid script that manages running robots and their required subprocesses. See the `carter_sim.yaml` configuration in the [BenchBot Supervisor](https://github.com/qcr/benchbot_supervisor) for an example configuration of how to run BenchBot Simulator through the Robot Controller.
